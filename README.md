# Operators and Loops
## Operators
*Operators are the symbols which are used to perform certain operations on the data e.g.*
* +	Addition
* -	Subtraction
* *	Multiplication
* /	Division
* %	Modulus (remainder) ( e.g. 3%2 = 1)
* ++	“Increment (e.g. if a = 1, then a++ = 2)”
* –	“Decrement (e.g. if a = 1, then a– = 0)”
* += -= *= /=	short notation (e.g.’a += 3’ indicates ‘a = a+3’
* equal	==
* not equal	!=
* greater	>
* smaller	<
* greater or equal	>=
* smaller or equal	<=
* OR	|
* AND	&
* XOR	^
* NOT	~
* Left Shift	<<
* Right Shift	>>
* &&	Logical AND operator
* ||	Logical OR Operator
* !	Logical NOT Operator
## Loops
*Loops are used to perform the operations repetitively. Three types of loop conditions‘for loop’, ‘while loop’ and ‘do while loop’*
